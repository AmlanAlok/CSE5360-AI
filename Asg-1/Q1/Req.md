1. Use state space search to solve the graph navigation problem
2. Alpha numeric sequence to represent location 1, then whitespace, floating num for distance

Graph search with uniform cost search strategy
Graph search with A* strategy

No scipy or numpy
Don't use any libraries



Nodes Popped: 12        -- nodes popped from the fringe
Nodes Expanded: 6       -- out of the popped ones how many did it generate successors for
Nodes Generated: 20     -- start with 1 node and then added 19 nodes to the fringe
Distance: 297.0 km      -- total path length
Route:                  -- shortest path route
